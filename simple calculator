# a simple arithmetic calculator using python programming

   # firstly we take input of two numbers from the user

num1 = float(input("Enter first number :  "))
num2 = float(input("Enter second number :  "))

# Take input of the operator that user want to perform
operator = input("Enter your operator :  ")

# perform the operations as per operator chosen

if operator =="+":
    print("sum is : ", num1+num2)
elif operator == "-":
    print("substraction is :",num1-num2)
elif operator =="*":
    print("product is :", num1*num2)
elif operator =="/":
    print("quotient is :",num1/num2)
else:
    print("Invalid Operator")
